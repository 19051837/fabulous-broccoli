This company will adopt the differentiation strategy because our AI-based innovative products make us stand out from the other entrants, and we highly  focus on resolving the pain areas of our clients to establish a sound relationship with them. Additionally, we aimed at targeting two major areas,which are production issues and security threats. Also, our services are easily adaptable to organization of any size

This enterprise is will be an early mover in the field of AI-based production environment issues mitigation and a single tool that provides integration with other security vulnerabilities platforms.

### More switching cost:

This tool needs integration with the customer's production servers through configuration files to analyze logs and gather metrics etc. Similarly, this tool needs to be integrated with other scanning tools such as Veracode and dashboards, used by the customer currently, which will make the switching cost to other solutions challenging as well as costlier for clients.

### Gain customer's confidence:

Being the first-player in this area will help this enterprise to establish sound relations with the customers. As this will be the primary solution for customers' requirements,they will open up more for their problems and will discuss the needs in detail, which will further help us to improve our tool capabilities.
