To start up the business we will be needing below items.

### Servers

We will be needing 3 different environments for development, test and production servers. Same servers we will use to host our database. We are choosing cloud-based servers as it will have a less initial cost and later once the business will be expanded, we will easily scale up servers according to the requirement.

### Business license

To register the company we need to follow legal regulations and paperwork and pay a fee for that.

### Employee salaries

We are beginning from a small team with one Solution Architect for designing the architecture of the overall application, one Artificial Intelligence developer for designing algorithm which will work in our backend services, two full stack developers to design the frontend and business logic of application and these people will also work on the database and 1 python developer and myself. Salary details are mentioned in the excel screenshot below. Since we will be hiring freelancers there is no cost involved in renting office space and furniture.

### HVD & software tools

Our team will be using virtual desktops to develop the solution and all the business meetings will be conducted through the WebEx portal. We aim to use as much as open source technologies as possible so that we can lower the cost of application software as much as possible. Some of the technologies we will be using are Java, Python, chatbots, etc. Moreover, our application will be running on Https protocol so we need to spend on buying SSL certificates.

### Content Writer

we will hire a content writer to write the content for our website and other templates. But this position will be on-demand basis whenever we will need the content writing services.
