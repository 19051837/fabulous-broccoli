    Nowadays many production support groups in IT-based companies spend hours every day to resolve
    common repetitive production issues owing to reasons such as, lack of knowledge and skills to
    troubleshoot the issues, lack of training, inadequate application software monitoring tools and at other
    times due to high attrition rate in an organization, layoffs due to a under-performing economy. Due to
    the above-mentioned reasons, large enterprises have to spend thousands of dollars to deal with these
    production issues. So, here comes the need for a new intelligent solution based on artificial intelligence
    which can continually observe exceptions and errors in productions logs and automatically trigger
    alarms/alerts to teams concerned and suggest solutions based on its previous learning on similar issues
    gained through defect management tools, and chatroom discussions, etc. Also, the applications can be
    configured to resolve low severity issues by immediately fixing problems such as space/memory issues,
    logs clean up, etc.

    Another major problem which most of the IT organizations are facing today is security vulnerabilities.
    These security flaws sometimes occur due to bad coding practices and inefficient web servers and
    application servers configuration. Although many companies have started using security tools to run
    scans on application code, yet the developers and configuration teams face a lot of hassles. This
    intelligent solution will have the capability to integrate with existing market solutions for security
    vulnerabilities. It can read vulnerability definitions from all integrated tools and suggest the needed code
    changes in the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) so that a developer need not worry about
    login into different tools to read security flaws, solutions, etc. Moreover, it will keep on learning and
    storing these code fixes on the centralized cloud so that new developers can make the use of experienced
    developersâ€™ knowledge and save their efforts to work on similar issues.
