### How we will reach out to our customers ?

Since we are targeting customers who deal with technology, we need to market this product through technology-based marketing channels.

Our first objective is to launch this product to a niche market segment as this product is a relatively new concept. By targeting limited customers, we will be able to improvise our product based on the customerâ€™s feedback before launching it on a larger scale. Our company will use LinkedIn to target our prospective customers and build network connections. We will set up free webinars demonstrating the capabilities of our product thereby promoting our product and establishing new connections and partnerships.

Once we will be confident enough based on the demand and customer feedback our next step will be market this product to the larger target audience through other social media channels such as YouTube. We will put advertisements showing the demo of our tool and its impressive features. Our advisement needs to be interesting and crisp and it should explain how it will help our customers to resolve their painful areas seamlessly.

Similarly, we will use other social networking platforms such as Google+, Twitter and Facebook to engage more customers.

### What are our strategies to secure, serve, and retain?

#### Securing customers:

we will be using social media marketing to gain new customers. we will be offering a free trial to new customers to the basic version of our product and we will be delivering free counselings sessions to understand their needs and offering them the customized version of our product to better serve their problem.This strategy will enable the customer to think this brand actually wants to understand my problem and offering me exactly what I am looking for.

#### Serving customers:

we will be sending regular feedback emails to make sure our customers are happy with our services. If they have any issues, we will immediately resolve it to serve them most effectively. Emails and telephone calls will help us to achieve this goal. Apart from that, we will regularly monitor the trends to fix the problem immediately if there is any downfall in existing customers.

#### Retaining customers:

we want to achieve long-term loyalty with the customer and for retaining old customers we will always try to deliver them more than their expectations.For example, if our response policy is 6 hours for their queries, we will make sure we will respond to them within 3 hours thereby exceeding their expectations. Another important aspect is personalized emails, we will be sending personalized emails such as birthdays emails so that customers will feel we care for them. Additionally, we will be giving discount offers, and rewards as an incentive to them in order to compel them to keep using our services.

The majority of the communications will be online.
